Optimal Multimodal Heterogeneous Sensor Placement for Arbitrary Agricultural Domains with Machine Learning


How to use these programs:
1. Run 'functions.py'
2. Open 'main.py'.  User may make changes to any variables precluded by a '#Define...' comment to match their desired scenario.  Run main.py.
3. Run 'plotting.py' to generate figures and visualize the sensor placement.
Note: You do not need to run areaGenerator.py - it is included in the functions.py

Samples of these outputs for 'Agricultural Field Example.jpg' are included for N = 1-10 sensors. The results are shown in plotDesigns.png and report.png.
