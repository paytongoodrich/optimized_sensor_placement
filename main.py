'''
Generate a global design matrix that will store the highest scoring design in designMatrix
Each row is the best design found for N sensors, where N is the row number + 1
Each row is a design where every two columns is an x,y coordinate of a sensor positioned within the field
The last value in each row is the fitness score (from 0-1)
Used for plotting the percentage of field coverage possible for N sensors

globaldesignMatrix = []

'''
Generate a scoring vector that records the 'best' design's fitness for each loop in the genetic algorithm
Used for plotting how the genetic algorithm 'learns' and improves itself over time
Also used for determining when the algorithm converges on for a given 'N'
